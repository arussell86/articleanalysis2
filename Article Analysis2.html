	<div id="summary">
	<p>The article titled: <i>Teacher’s union and compensation: 
	The Impact of Collective Bargaining on Salary Schedules and Performance Pay Schemes</i> was written by <I>Krtistine Lamm West</i> and <i>Elton Mykerezi</i> in 2011. 
	The article focuses on the impact <strong>collective baragaining</strong> has on all dimensions of teacher compensation. 
	These dimensions include: <strong>average and starting salaries, early and late returns on teaching experience, the returns on graduate degrees, and finally the different pay for performance pay schemes.</strong> 
	
	These criteria are used to find out the depth of the impact data from the <strong>School and Staffing Survey</strong> and <strong>The Teachers Rules and Rights</strong> in order to extract data on collective bargaining. 
	The data revealed that collective bargaining had an impact on  all aspects of current qualification specific salary schedules. 
	Further more these negotiations also impact the design structure of performance pay plans. 
	The unions involved in these negotiations encourage ruling that the bonuses teachers receive be based on qualifications and experience versus improving overall scores on standardized tests.
Although the issue with teacher compensation started years prior it did not garner national attention until the passage of the <strong>No Child Left Behind Act</strong> in 2001.<br><br>

The main purpose of the act was to close the achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. This act required all schools to give annual standardized to test to measure basic skills assessment at select grade levels in order to receive funding. 
The tests is standard across all grades levels with minor changes and the improved scores determine the amount of funding or whether the school gets funding. 
There are people that either support it or do not support it. While the act is seen as holding schools accountable for the standard of the education, critics of the act see the test as only focuses on the basic skills to increase the overall average for the test rather than focusing on the deeper understanding of all subject areas to create a well rounded student. 
When the focus is primarily on the test for funding purposes the students lose and quality teachers are difficult to retain. 
The quality of teachers are directly tied into student achievement and the focus on the tests diminishes the overall quality of the educational system.
This study uses two separate data sets. 

The first dataset is the Teachers Rules and Rights otherwise known as <strong>TR3</strong> compiled by the <strong>National Council for Teacher Quality</strong>. The other is the School and Staffing Survey otherwise known as <strong>SASS</strong> complied by the <strong>National Center for Education Statistics.</strong> 
Combined both organizations represent a sample of over <strong>4000</strong> school districts and gather data from teacher contracts from <strong>100</strong> of the largest school districts in each state order to compile the data. <br><br>
One of the drawbacks of TR3 is that because it only represents the largest school districts it not a representative sample because the smaller districts may or may not have same system in place or salaries. 
In addition although SASS has a large sample size for school districts it does not have complete teacher salary schedules or information on the effect of the pay for performance system. 
Despite the weaknesses of both systems there is a <strong>crossover analysis</strong> that can compensate for it. The vast majority of districts in the TR3 are also in the SASS. These districts also have similar systems for calculating teacher salaries and in a study could minimize any sampling bias geared toward one data set over the other.
When looking over the data it is shown that the average teacher salary with a bachelor’s  degree is between <strong>$25,000-$32,000</strong> per year versus those without. Experience and education net increases in salary however the percentage increases by different increment as one is bases on tenure due years in career versus steps taken outside of the career to gain additional education. 
This being said there is more incentive to for teachers to pursue additional education.  The differences in range could be attributed to school location which will either be in an urban or suburban environment. The average increase in salary is <strong>3%</strong> in the first <strong>10</strong> years of their career. This number will increase or decrease depending on the number years a teacher as acquired. 
An alternative measure to calculate would be the number years is takes a teacher to reach their maximum salary given they hold the same degree. This time frame is reported to be approximately <strong>20 years</strong> and does not take into account the districts where the salary would increase to beyond that time frame. From this data it was calculated that a teacher with a bachelor’s degree over a 20 year period will gain increase of approximately <strong>27%</strong> over the course of their career. 
The average teacher earning a master’s degree was shown to be an average of a <strong>9%</strong> salary increment increase over the bacheolor’s which contributes an overall greater salary increase over the 20 year time frame.<br><br>

Ultimately unions for teachers are created to address the concerns with salary with a sole purpose of reducing the number of years it takes to reach the maximum salary. In comparison to non-unionized teachers it takes approxaimately <strong>12.9 years</strong> faster to reach the maximum allowable salary. 
The union influence also maximizes it’s members lifetime earnings by increasing the years until the time-frame a teacher can choose to retire versus a forced retirement, thus allowing them to earn more in the lifetime of their career. In summary unions influence increase the <strong>starting salary for teachers, the returns of experience and fringe benefits, and increase the returns on additional education.</strong>
The only increase they do not advocate is the pay for performance because not only will that change every year, the criteria used is up to each individual state. The decision for funding is ultimately up to the federal government and partially the state, and therefore each entity have the right to set the guidelines for the funding. 
However as mentioned in the first part of the summary the main criticism of the No child left Behind act is that the focus is placed primarily on the average scores of the standardized test. When this happens the overall teaching criteria becomes focused preparing for this test to receive and retain funding. Due to this quality teachers become difficult to retain and the overall quality of the system diminishes because it presents a narrow criteria for teaching that puts focuses on funding rather than student development.

	<p>This article was well written in included a lot of detail regarding statistical data about the aspects of the collective bargaining for teachers. 
	The article went into detail about the avenues affected by collective bargaining and implied key differences between influence of union and non-unionized schools. 
	It also outlined what the avenues for influence were and showed the numbers for how they affect the salaries of these teachers from early career until retirement. 
	The key criticism about this article is that although it focuses on the unions it did not spend enough time explaining the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act as well as the general funding criteria for the states. 
	The article could have also could have went to more detail about the general guidelines for standardized testing in the basic key areas to understand the impact of the focus on these subjects and how the they effect the teaching methods of the employees. 
	If the article had included more detail into these two areas it would have helped greatly in understanding the guidelines that were used in the reference for the collective bargaining and explain the numbers outside of the two data sets that were used to gather the information.
